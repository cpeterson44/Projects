# Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Hello!

This github page serves as a publically-visible hub for many of the notable projects I am currently working on or have worked on in the past. This page intends to serve as a both a sampler to give an overall picture of the various projects I have worked on, as well as a resource that can direct individuals to repository links containing code and more detailed explanations.

The projects on this page are not currently ordered in any meaningful way beyond simple alphabetical order. Each project's description contains a few important facts, including language and dates, as well as a brief summary of the problem and how the project aims to solve/solved it.

Many of the repositories this page links to are private. Contact me if you'd like access to them or to their code.
