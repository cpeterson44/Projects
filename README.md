# Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Hello!

This github page serves as a publically-visible hub for many of the notable projects I am currently working on or have worked on in the past. This page intends to serve as a both a sampler to give an overall picture of the various projects I have worked on, as well as a resource that can direct individuals to repository links containing code and more detailed explanations.

The projects on this page are not currently ordered in any meaningful way beyond simple alphabetical order. Each project's description contains a few important facts, including language and dates, as well as a brief summary of the problem and how the project aims to solve/solved it.

Many of the repositories this page links to are private. Contact me if you'd like access to them or to their code.

This repository contains several small-medium assignments from CS 480, the Artifical Intelligence course offered at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. These assignments were structured as a variety of nuanced challenges, which each required a different algorithm and/or approach to solve quickly and efficiently. Although we were given some guidance on which algorithms to use, we were largely left on our own to research and determine implementation details.

Some of the algorithms/concepts covered include:
* [A* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
* [Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
* [Beam Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search)
* [Boolean Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra)
* [Genetic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
* [Hill Climbing Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)

[CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges](https://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/cyber-security-capture-the-flag-ctf-what-is-it) are exercises designed to test a user's creativity and knowledge of security concepts. In these challenges, a vulnerable program or service is presented with a hidden "flag" that can only be accessed by someone who has discovered the vulnerability and compromised the security of the program.

This repository contains my solutions to the CTF challenges for CS 279, one of UCSB's graduate Computer Security courses. Where possible, I've included the challenge binary and a description of the challenge, the vulnerability, and the attack my program executes to get the flag. Most of the exploits are 100% reliable, but due to the nature of some of the challenges, some exploits require multiple attempts to access the flag.

Some of the exploits/concepts covered by the CTF challenges include:
* [Arbitrary Code Execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution)
* [ASLR & Address Leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)
* [Brute-Force Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)

[FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) is a software interface for Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems in user space without editing kernel code. A FUSE file system is used the same as a standard file system except that all normal system calls (ex. mkdir, mknod, read, write, etc.) are passed to and handled by the FUSE program instead of the kernal.

For this project, our group had to design a robust filesystem implementation from scratch in C. We implemented the following core Unix system calls, with syntax and return values matching the `man` page specifications:
* `getattr`
* `readdir`
* `mknod`
* `mkdir`
* `unlink`
* `rmdir`
* `truncate`
* `open`
* `read`
* `write`

Our file system was a layered implementation of the [basic UNIX FS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_File_System#History_and_evolution), containing a superblock, a list of inodes, and a list of data blocks:
* **Layer 0:** Functions that handle raw disk bytes and abstract them to disk blocks
* **Layer 1:** Functions that handle disk blocks and abstract them to inodes & data
* **Layer 2:** Functions that handle inodes and abstract them to files and directories
* **Layer 3:** FUSE integration layer

To improve performance and to match UNIX semantics, we also implented a bitmap for free inodes, an open file table, and an in-place free list. Additionally, we wrote automatic tests for each layer of our file system and added built-in debugging functionality at each step of the design process.
